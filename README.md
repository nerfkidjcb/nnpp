# NNPP (Neural Network Plus Plus)
Silly manual implementation of nns in cpp

## What is here
So far I've made a basic shallow net that can handle very little. But its the thought that counts.

## Run it
If you are somehow reading this, just compile the working* shallow net with `g++ -o shallow_network main.cpp ShallowNeuralNetwork.cpp DataSetHandler.cpp DataSetGenerator.cpp` and run it with `./shallow_network`
